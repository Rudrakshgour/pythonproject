The Virtual Pointer is a state-of-the-art digital mouse that performs conventional mouse tasks without the need for physical hardware. It does this by using machine learning methods.A camera is used by the Virtual Pointer system to record and translate human fingertip motions into commands like left-click, right-click, and scroll.
For many years, the computer mouse served as
the primary input device, but as technology advances, new
input methods are appearing. Although Bluetooth technology
advanced significantly, it still depends on physical hardware.
The Virtual Pointer is a state-of-the-art digital mouse that
performs conventional mouse tasks without the need for
physical hardware. It does this by using machine learning
methods.A camera is used by the Virtual Pointer system to
record and translate human fingertip motions into commands
like left-click, right-click, and scroll. This novel strategy saves
time and energy and lessens physical stress. The Virtual
Pointer's machine learning algorithms also enable
customisation based on the unique movements and preferences
of each user. The Virtual Pointer offers a more versatile and
flexible input method that is not constrained by physical
hardware as compared to conventional mice and touchpads. It
offers users a highly personalized and effective experience
thanks to the usage of machine learning algorithms. An
innovative advancement in input device technology that has
the potential to completely change how we interact with
computers is the virtual pointer
